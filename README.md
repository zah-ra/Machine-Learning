# Machine Learning

## Description
In this project, we are going to estimate the price of cars in the advertisement of a website. We want to try to find the optimal hyperparameters for each model with the help of the scikit learn library, and finally compare the results of the models.

## Introducing the Dataset
The dataset is a number of ads posted for the sale of cars on a website. In this data set, in addition to several columns that contain various information about the car, there is a price column, that will be the target of the model.
Project is done is three pahses: 1- preprocess and visualization 2- price prediction 3- ensemble learning
